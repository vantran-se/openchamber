# File tree loading and visibility

`FilesView` and `SidebarFilesTree` keep directory snapshots in component state.
`DirectoryRequests` owns shared in-flight reads and supersession. Repeated
same-path callers await the same request; an explicit mutation refresh can
replace it. Scope changes and unmount clear the coordinator, so old completions
cannot publish or remove a newer request's slot. Callers also check runtime
identity at completion.

Directory arrays retain their references when every rendered field and ordering
matches. `fileTreeStatus.ts` builds path and ancestor indexes once per Git
snapshot. Open-file membership has its own set, so changing tabs does not
rebuild the Git index.

Desktop `FilesView` in editor-only mode neither loads nor constructs its unused
tree. Mobile retains its tree. The context panel passes actual visibility,
including both the panel's open state and its active tab, to each file surface.
Hidden surfaces retain drafts, loaded content and scroll state. They stop
directory and file metadata polling; reopening checks freshness once before
normal polling resumes. Autosave is independent of visibility.

Background polling never supersedes an in-flight directory read. Explicit
refresh after file mutations does. Each directory failure remains local and
preserves its previous successful snapshot.

Sidebar root/runtime changes remount the scoped tree. Its bounded module cache
provides continuity between mounts; request cancellation for collapsed paths
stops queued batches, while already-started reads may populate the same-scope
cache. Runtime changes and unmount invalidate those active reads.
