# OpenChamber Desktop

Electron desktop runtime for OpenChamber on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

This package owns the native shell: windows, menus, deep links, native notifications, auto-updates, host switching, SSH connections, tunnel helpers, and packaged desktop builds. The web UI and OpenChamber server logic still live in `packages/web` and shared React UI lives in `packages/ui`.

## How It Runs

Desktop starts the OpenChamber web server in the same Electron main process. There is no separate sidecar subprocess for the OpenChamber server.

`main.mjs` imports `@openchamber/web/server/index.js` and calls `startWebUiServer()`. The Electron window then loads the UI from the local server in development, or from packaged `resources/web-dist` assets in packaged builds.

Same-origin session-chat iframes complete an authenticated parent-frame handshake before creating their SDK client. The parent supplies its active in-memory endpoint and credentials; when relay is active it also supplies the public relay descriptor without any pairing grant, because Electron preload and IPC are unavailable inside the iframe. The iframe establishes its own transport and rebinds its SDK before rendering. Additional windows retain their own per-window runtime bootstrap instead of being overwritten by the main window. Credentials are never placed in iframe URLs, and other child pages do not receive this runtime state.

The preload bridge exposes desktop-only APIs to the web UI through `window.__OPENCHAMBER_DESKTOP__`. Privileged commands are checked in `main.mjs`, not only in the UI.

## Development

From the repo root:

```bash
bun install
bun run electron:dev
```

`bun run electron:dev` starts the web dev server with HMR, then launches Electron against `packages/electron/main.mjs`.

The Electron workspace package trusts Electron's install script so `bun install` downloads the platform runtime in fresh checkouts and worktrees.

Electron's postinstall (`node install.js`) is run by `bun install` with the system Node. Older Electron releases bundled `extract-zip@2.0.1`, which under Node 24 silently unpacked only the first entry of the Electron zip, leaving `dist/` without the binary and `path.txt` missing. Electron 43+ ships its own fixed extractor (`@electron-internal/extract-zip`), but to keep interrupted or wrong-architecture installs from blocking desktop work:

- The root `postinstall` runs `ensure-electron.mjs --best-effort`, which detects an incomplete Electron install (missing binary, stale `dist/version`/`path.txt`, or a binary of the wrong architecture) and repairs it by re-running the postinstall under Bun (which extracts correctly), falling back to Node.
- `electron-dev.mjs` runs the same check (fail-fast, not best-effort) before launching, so `bun run electron:dev` self-heals even when an install was interrupted.
- The check can be run on demand with `bun run --cwd packages/electron ensure:electron`; set `ELECTRON_SKIP_BINARY_DOWNLOAD=1` to skip repair (e.g. CI without a network).
- Unit tests in `scripts/ensure-electron.test.mjs` (run via `bun run --cwd packages/electron test:architecture`) cover healthy/missing/stale installs, wrong-architecture binaries, repair fallback, and `--best-effort`.

Useful variants:

```bash
bun run electron:dev:bundled
bun run --cwd packages/electron ensure:electron
bun run type-check:electron
bun run lint:electron
```

`electron:dev:bundled` builds and uses packaged web assets instead of the HMR server. Use it when testing behavior closer to a packaged app.

## Packaging

From the repo root:

```bash
bun run electron:build
```

That runs, in order:

1. `build:web-assets` to build the web UI and copy it into `packages/electron/resources/web-dist`.
2. `prepare:opencode-cli` to download/cache the pinned OpenCode CLI and copy it into `packages/electron/resources/opencode-cli`.
3. `bundle:main` to create `packages/electron/dist-bundle/main.mjs`.
4. `rebuild:native` to rebuild native modules for Electron.
5. `package.mjs` to run `electron-builder`; its `afterPack` hook stages the compiled macOS icon asset catalog.

Build output goes to `packages/electron/dist`.

macOS builds produce `dmg` and `zip` artifacts. Windows builds produce an NSIS installer. Linux builds produce an AppImage for the native x64 or arm64 host.

## Platform Notes

macOS packaging needs Xcode/build tools for notarized builds and icon asset compilation.

Windows packaging needs NSIS support through `electron-builder`. If no Windows signing env is set, `package.mjs` disables code signing and builds an unsigned installer. Windows updates use `latest.yml` for x64 and the `latest-arm64.yml` channel for ARM64 so each installation resolves an architecture-matching installer.

Linux AppImages must be built natively. Set `OPENCHAMBER_TARGET_ARCH=x64` or `OPENCHAMBER_TARGET_ARCH=arm64` when packaging; the build rejects a target that does not match the Linux host. The same target selects the bundled OpenCode CLI, native Electron rebuild, and Electron Builder architecture. Linux identity is stable across architectures: executable `openchamber`, desktop file `openchamber.desktop`, icon `openchamber`, and `StartupWMClass=openchamber`.

After packaging, run `bun run --cwd packages/electron verify:linux-appimage`. The verifier extracts the final AppImage and checks its ELF architecture, desktop identity, Electron executable, pinned OpenCode CLI version and architecture, and all packaged native `.node` modules.

Running a packaged Linux AppImage requires FUSE (`libfuse.so.2`, typically `libfuse2` / `libfuse2t64` on Debian/Ubuntu). Without FUSE, start with `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1`. Keep the AppImage on a writable path so in-app updates can replace it.

Desktop clears AppImage `ARGV0` from `process.env` before probing the login shell and starting the in-process server. Leaving it set makes zsh rewrite argv[0] for integrated-terminal and managed-OpenCode child commands to the AppImage path.

Linux updates are supported only when the packaged app is running from a writable AppImage. Update checks, downloads, and installation report an actionable error when `APPIMAGE` is missing, invalid, or read-only; a missing release feed (`latest-linux.yml` 404 before the first Linux publish) is treated as “no update available”. macOS and Windows updater behavior is unchanged. Release builds keep `latest-linux.yml` (x64) and `latest-linux-arm64.yml` separate and validate each manifest against its AppImage before upload. Linux AppImages download full updates (no `.blockmap` differential channel yet).

`desktop_restart` does not answer the renderer before the install is decided. On the apply-update path it calls `quitAndInstall()` and keeps the IPC call open until the app quits or `autoUpdater` emits `error`, which the platform installers do asynchronously (a rejected code signature, or a Squirrel session disabled by an earlier failure). A failed install rejects the IPC call so the update dialog can show it, and the quit/install flags are rolled back because the app is staying up. A still-running app after the grace period resolves the call.

### Updater End-to-End Fixture

A loopback-only updater fixture is available for contributor QA of N-to-N+1 AppImage replacement and restart behavior. It is test infrastructure, not a user-configurable update source. See [`scripts/updater-e2e-fixture.md`](./scripts/updater-e2e-fixture.md) for the controlled test procedure. Unit tests cover feed selection, check failures, no-update results, and fixture generation; actual AppImage replacement and restart remains a manual native N-to-N+1 release boundary because it requires executing two packaged versions on each supported architecture.

The package supports macOS, Windows, and Linux desktop features. Linux AppImage builds include in-app window controls, auto-update, system tray (right-click Show / Hide / Close), and launch-at-login (XDG autostart). Opening files in installed apps, installed-app discovery, and FreeDesktop icon lookup (including the default file manager) work on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

On Windows and Linux, the General setting persisted as `desktopMinimizeToTrayEnabled` keeps the app running in the tray when the main window is **closed**. Minimize — the in-app control, the native title-bar button, and the taskbar — always performs a normal window minimize, so the taskbar entry stays available.

The macOS menu bar item is enabled by default and can be disabled in General settings. The setting applies after restart; while disabled, Desktop does not create the native tray controller or start the renderer subscriptions, polling, quota refresh, or IPC updates that feed it.

## Bundled OpenCode CLI

Packaged Desktop builds include the official OpenCode CLI that matches the pinned `@opencode-ai/sdk` version in the root `package.json`. `prepare:opencode-cli` downloads the platform-specific release artifact, caches it under `packages/electron/.cache/opencode-cli`, stages `opencode` or `opencode.exe` into `resources/opencode-cli`, and verifies `opencode --version` before packaging. Re-running the step is fast when the staged binary already matches the pinned version.

Managed local Desktop startup prefers OpenCode binaries in this order:

1. `settings.opencodeBinary`.
2. Environment overrides: `OPENCODE_BINARY`, `OPENCODE_PATH`, `OPENCHAMBER_OPENCODE_PATH`, or `OPENCHAMBER_OPENCODE_BIN`.
3. The bundled Desktop CLI in `process.resourcesPath/opencode-cli`.
4. System installs discovered from PATH.
5. Known npm/Bun/Homebrew/Scoop/Chocolatey and other standard install locations.
6. Platform discovery through `where opencode` on Windows or a login shell on macOS/Linux.

Use an explicit override when testing a different OpenCode CLI build or when a user needs to point Desktop at a custom binary. The configured path must point to the standalone CLI, not the OpenCode Desktop app executable.

## Common Env Vars

| Variable | Use |
|----------|-----|
| `OPENCHAMBER_ELECTRON_DEV=1` | Marks the runtime as desktop development mode |
| `OPENCHAMBER_ELECTRON_USE_BUNDLED_UI=1` | Uses staged web assets instead of the HMR dev server |
| `OPENCHAMBER_SKIP_LOCAL_SERVER=1` | Skips the in-process local OpenChamber server and uses the configured default remote instance; Desktop imports this from the user's login-shell environment, and packaged/bundled UI remains available for connection recovery |
| `OPENCHAMBER_HMR_UI_PORT` | Preferred Vite UI port for desktop dev, default `5173` |
| `OPENCHAMBER_HMR_API_PORT` | Preferred API port for desktop dev, default `3901` |
| `OPENCHAMBER_RUNTIME=desktop` | Set by Electron before starting the web server |
| `OPENCHAMBER_OPENCODE_CLI_VERSION` | Optional packaging override for the bundled OpenCode CLI version; defaults to the pinned root `@opencode-ai/sdk` version |
| `OPENCHAMBER_TARGET_ARCH` | Explicit desktop package architecture (`x64` or `arm64`); Linux requires it to match the native host |
| `OPENCHAMBER_DESKTOP_NOTIFY=true` | Enables desktop notification flow in the web server |
| `OPENCHAMBER_SKIP_API_COMPRESSION=true` | Defaulted by Desktop to reduce local CPU overhead |
| `OPENCHAMBER_STARTUP_PERF=1` | Enables privacy-safe startup phase timings in Desktop/server logs; disabled by default |
| `OPENCODE_HOST` / `OPENCODE_PORT` / `OPENCODE_SKIP_START` | Connect Desktop to an external OpenCode server instead of starting one locally |

## Native Features Owned Here

- Floating Mini Chat windows.
- New Mini Chat windows default to the managed Chats target. Explicit project/worktree drafts retain their target, existing managed chat sessions reopen in their own directory, and the compact header omits project/branch metadata for Chats. Opening a managed draft back in the main window preserves that target.
- Multiple native windows.
- Native notifications.
- User-confirmed local folder selection. The shared UI supplies the requested directory as the picker `defaultPath`; confirmation is required before filesystem access is retried.
- One-click open/reveal/open-in-app actions.
- Desktop host switcher and deep-link imports.
- Local and remote instance handling.
- SSH host import, connections, logs, and port forwarding.
- SSH uses OpenSSH ControlMaster on macOS/Linux. Windows uses independent hidden OpenSSH processes for setup commands and each long-lived forward because Win32 OpenSSH does not support ControlMaster reliably.
- Tunnel lifecycle integration through the web server runtime.
- Remote dev-server previews use a direct WebSocket tunnel when the instance has an HTTP address. Relay-only instances keep the encrypted relay transport in the renderer and bridge its raw bytes to the browser panel through a local Electron listener.
- Auto-update checks, downloads, and restart/apply flow.
- The browser panel's own session (`persist:openchamber-browser`): its storage is
  cleared only through the scoped clear-data command, and camera, microphone,
  location, and device-picker requests from pages shown there are denied. Electron
  grants permission requests by default when no handler is set, and the panel
  loads whatever address the user types. Tab favicons are fetched in this
  session too, so icons behind the page's own login resolve and the app's origin
  never requests anything from a third-party host. Self-signed loopback HTTPS
  pages may use an untrusted certificate authority; certificate failures for
  external hosts and all other certificate errors remain blocked.

## IPC Pattern

Renderer code should call the desktop bridge exposed by `preload.mjs`. Do not import Electron from shared UI code.

Add new native capabilities in this order:

1. Add or update the `preload.mjs` bridge only if a new renderer-facing shape is needed.
2. Add the real command handling in `main.mjs` under `openchamber:invoke`.
3. Gate privileged commands in main process logic so remote pages cannot access local filesystem or shell capabilities.
4. Keep shared UI runtime contracts in `packages/ui` and server/runtime APIs in `packages/web` when the behavior is not inherently native.

## Logs And Data

Electron uses `electron-log`. In development, console logs are also visible in the terminal. In packaged apps, logs are written through the platform log path for the `OpenChamber` app name.

Development builds use a separate user data directory named `OpenChamber Dev`, so dev state does not overwrite normal packaged app state.

## Things To Be Careful With

- Keep desktop-specific code in this package. Do not move OpenCode feature backend logic into Electron.
- Use hidden Windows process launches for background helpers. Avoid visible console flashes.
- Keep `@openchamber/web`, `bun-pty`, `node-pty`, and native modules external in `bundle-main.mjs`; bundling them can break Electron startup.
- Rebuild native modules after dependency or Electron version changes.
- Test both HMR dev mode and bundled UI mode when changing startup, preload, routing, or packaged asset behavior.
