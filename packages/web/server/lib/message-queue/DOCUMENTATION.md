# Message Queue

## Purpose

Owns the messages a user queued while a session was busy, and sends them the
moment the session goes idle. The queue lives in the web server so a closed
tab, a locked phone, or a dropped connection no longer strands it. Structural
template: `permission-auto-accept` — the server is authoritative, the shared UI
renders a projection, and VS Code (which has no server of its own) keeps its
UI-side queue and foreground auto-send hook.

## Files

- `runtime.js` — `createMessageQueueRuntime(...)` (state, persistence,
  dispatch loop, event handling) and `registerMessageQueueRoutes(app, runtime)`.
- `runtime.test.js` — delivery, idleness gates, retries, holds, persistence,
  concurrency with in-flight sends, slash commands, and project knowledge.

Wiring: created in `server/index.js` after the global event hub and the
session-knowledge runtime; routes registered in
`opencode/feature-routes-runtime.js` (before the generic OpenCode proxy) with
JSON bodies enabled in `opencode/core-routes.js`; stopped by
`opencode/shutdown-runtime.js`.

## Item

An item is what the UI would have sent itself, captured at queue time so the
send never re-resolves mutable UI state:

```
{
  id, createdAt,
  content,        // raw text for display and editing
  text,           // text to deliver (agent mention stripped, file mentions resolved); defaults to content
  agentMention?,  // delivered as an `agent` part
  attachments: [{ id, filename, mimeType, size, source, serverPath?, dataUrl }],
  context: [      // what the composer had attached, in send order
    { kind: 'context', text, metadata, instructions? },  // a draft chip or linked issue/PR; metadata is the UI's structured payload
    { kind: 'instruction', text },                       // derived from the text (skill instruction)
    { kind: 'synthetic', text },                         // handed to the composer by another surface
  ],
  sendConfig: { providerID, modelID, agent?, variant? }   // required
}
```

The server is a courier for `context`: it validates the shape (a kind it
knows, a `metadata` object on `context` entries) and delivers each entry as a
synthetic text part, an entry's `instructions` going out as its own part just
before it and its `metadata` riding the part verbatim so the timeline renders
the context block back. The payload inside `metadata` is the UI's contract
(`lib/messages/contextParts.ts`), parsed by the UI on the way back.

`parseQueuedItemInput` rejects anything the server could not deliver later
(no text, attachments, or context; missing model; malformed attachment or
context entry). Public snapshots and broadcasts strip the payloads —
attachment `dataUrl` (megabytes of base64) and `context` (a PR diff, say) —
so they do not ride every update; the only way to get them back is a `take`.

## Persistence

`<data-dir>/message-queue.json` (`OPENCHAMBER_DATA_DIR` or
`~/.config/openchamber`): `{ version, revision, sessions: { [sessionId]:
{ directory, items } } }`, written atomically (temp file + rename) through a
serialized write chain. A missing file is an empty queue. A malformed file is
a failure, not an empty queue: it is moved aside as
`message-queue.json.corrupt-<timestamp>` before the runtime starts empty, so
the next write cannot overwrite the user's data. A failed read leaves writes
disabled until a later load succeeds. `revision` is a global monotonic counter
bumped on every mutation; clients use it to reject stale snapshots.

In-memory only, deliberately: the in-flight item (`sendingId`), retry
backoff, abort timestamps, and holds. A restart has no in-flight sends; a
persisted "sending" flag would strand a message forever.

## Delivery loop

1. `start()` subscribes to the global upstream hub and loads the file; on
   load and on every hub `connect` it arms every session that has items.
2. `session.status` for a queued session: `idle` arms a short quiet timer
   (500 ms, coalescing the burst around a turn boundary), `busy`/`retry`
   clears it. A `message.updated` for a completed assistant reply arms as
   well, so a missed idle event cannot strand the queue. `session.deleted`
   drops the session's queue. An assistant `MessageAbortedError` records an
   abort.
3. `tick(sessionId)` bails when the queue is empty, an item is in flight, or
   the session is held. It re-arms after a 2 s post-abort hold (the UI's
   old behavior: a stop is not immediately followed by the next prompt) or
   while the head item is in retry backoff.
4. Idleness is re-verified against OpenCode before sending, because
   `prompt_async` into a running turn steers into it instead of starting the
   next one: `GET /session/status` must not list the session as busy/retry,
   and the trailing message must not be an unfinished assistant reply (the
   status map only lists busy sessions, so a missed busy event leaves no
   entry while a turn still streams). A failed fetch is unknown, never idle:
   the tick re-arms with backoff.
5. The head is marked in flight (broadcast), then sent:
   - text starting with `/` that names a command in OpenCode's `/command`
     list (skills included) and carries no captured context goes to
     `POST /session/:id/command` with the captured model, agent, variant, and
     file parts. That route accepts file parts only, so a command queued
     **with** context takes the prompt route instead, the same rule the
     composer applies: the command's template is expanded with its arguments
     (`$ARGUMENTS`, `$1..$N`, or appended), a skill keeps its `/name args` text
     and gets an explicit "the user invoked this skill" synthetic part after
     the context;
   - otherwise `POST /session/:id/prompt_async` with the parts in the same
     order a UI send uses: text, files, the captured context, the skill
     invocation when there is one, pending project knowledge
     (`sessionKnowledgeRuntime.resolvePendingForSession`, synthetic, recorded
     as delivered only after the prompt is accepted), then the agent mention.
   Success removes the item, persists, broadcasts, and marks the user
   message sent for notifications. Failure keeps the item, backs off
   2 s → 60 s (doubling per consecutive failure of that item), and re-arms.
6. The next item goes out after the next busy → idle cycle.

## Holds

Auto-review is driven from the UI and bounces the original session through
idle between iterations; the UI tells the server to hold that session's queue
(`PUT .../hold { held: true, ttlMs? }`) while a run is going and releases it
when the run ends. A hold expires on its own (default 5 min, cap 10 min)
because the UI that asserted it may be gone; the UI re-asserts it every two
minutes while the run continues. Releasing arms a dispatch.

## Routes (`/api/message-queue`)

Normal authenticated OpenChamber runtime routes; never on browser URL-token
allowlists.

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/message-queue` | Full snapshot `{ revision, sessions[] }` |
| `POST .../sessions/:id/items` | Append `{ directory, item }`; returns `{ revision, session, itemId }` and arms a dispatch (the session may already be idle) |
| `DELETE .../sessions/:id/items/:itemId` | Remove; `409` while that item is in flight |
| `POST .../sessions/:id/items/:itemId/take` | Remove and return the full item (payloads included); `404`/`409` |
| `POST .../sessions/:id/take` | Remove and return every item not in flight, in order |
| `PUT .../sessions/:id/order` | `{ itemIds }` must be a complete permutation |
| `DELETE .../sessions/:id` | Clear; the in-flight item stays |
| `PUT .../sessions/:id/hold` | `{ held, ttlMs? }` |

Every mutation broadcasts `openchamber:message-queue.updated` with
`{ revision, session }` to all connected clients (SSE and WS), so several
devices on one server see one queue. The session in that payload always names
its `directory`, including the broadcast that removes the last item: the UI
keys its projection by directory, and a broadcast without one left the
delivered message on screen (a session's directory is remembered until the
session is deleted or evicted).

Limits: 20 items per session, 50 sessions (oldest evicted, never one with an
item in flight), 200k characters of content; attachment payloads are bounded
by the route family's 50 MB JSON limit.

## UI ownership

`packages/ui/src/stores/messageQueueStore.ts` is the projection: see its
section in `packages/ui/src/stores/DOCUMENTATION.md`. VS Code intentionally
does not use this module; with all OpenChamber webviews closed, queued
messages there are not delivered.
