// Provider state that exists only inside the running OpenCode process.
//
// A plugin registers its provider from the `config` hook and supplies the
// credential from its `auth` loader, both at startup. Neither ends up in
// `opencode.json` or `auth.json`, so a server that only reads files sees
// nothing — which is why plugin-backed models used to fail here with
// "has no known API base URL" while working fine in chat (#2666).
//
// `GET /provider` is where that state becomes visible. It reports, per
// provider, the resolved `options.baseURL` and `options.apiKey`, and per model
// the wire adapter (`api.npm`) and endpoint (`api.url`). The provider-level
// endpoint remains only as a fallback when the selected model has no endpoint.
//
// What it does NOT report is `options.fetch`. OpenCode strips functions from
// the response, and a plugin is free to put its whole protocol in there:
// rewriting the path, signing the request, translating the payload. Such a
// provider advertises a perfectly ordinary base URL that answers nothing we
// know how to ask, and no field distinguishes the two.
//
// Asking the endpoint (`GET /models`) looked like the way to tell them apart,
// and it does answer correctly for that case — but measured against the 166
// providers in the models.dev catalog it also denies six that work fine and
// simply have no `/models` route. A provider that vanishes from the picker
// explains nothing; one that fails on use says why. So this module reports
// what it knows and leaves the verdict to the call itself.
